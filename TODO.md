* fix revealjs image bullshi
    * is there some way to just force <img> tags always? or at least get rid of the `\` rmarkdown puts after the markdown image tags?
    * (specifying fig.retina seems to work.)
* actually write talk slides...
    * let's start w/ methods and results
        * [done] one distribution -> predicted category boundary -> measured category boundary
        * [done-ish] modeling methods
        * [done] model fits to data
        * [done] inferred prior figure
        * [done] (w/ matt's prevoicing data, too)
            * fix arrow and caption for prevoicing
    * [done] reference slide of "questions" to keep coming back to
    * write intro slides
        * (with placeholders for any fancy intro animations)
    * writ conclusion slides
* Themeing
    * get rid of border around images
    * fonts and colors
* Intro figures/animations
    * Category boundary animations for particles?
    * Or skip animations altogether and just show samples?
