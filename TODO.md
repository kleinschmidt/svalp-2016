* actually write talk slides...
    * let's start w/ methods and results
        * [done] one distribution -> predicted category boundary -> measured category boundary
        * [done-ish] modeling methods
        * [done] model fits to data
        * [done] inferred prior figure
        * [done] (w/ matt's prevoicing data, too)

    * [done] writ conclusion slides
    * [done] convert modeling into prose-y-r versions:
        * somethign like "given prior beliefs and inpu, __predict__ adaptation"
        * vs. "given adaptation and input, __infer__ prior beliefs"
