# Abstract

## Conclusion framing

Possible alternative: 

Listeners _do_ use prior experience with groups to shape perception.

One hand, basic speech perception problem (lack of invariance). On the other hand, sociolinguistic variation. Bring these together: variation that's _predictable_ based on prior experience is actually _helpful_ because it accelerate adaptation to similar talkers in the future. This work provides a methodological tool to _probe_ listeners beliefs about different social variables.

We've demonstrated this at the level of the language as a whole, but this method can be just as well applied to investigate listeners' beliefs about the accents of more specific social variables (like gender, region, class, age, etc.).  This provides a potential bridge between

So: at $588 - 43 = 545$.  If I can get it down to 543 I think that's okay. (not counting expanded citation keys but whatever. could always use numeric citations).

Figure captions are $34 + 20 = 54$.



# Talk framing

* what is variation? two perspectives:
    * speech perception: a challenge for listeners to overcome. "lack of invariance", variability in sound-meaning mapping across talkers. until recently, research focuses on making it _go away_.
    * sociophonetics: a source of important information about a talker. 
* INFERENCE perspective: 
    * it's BOTH: listeners do have to cope with differences in sound-meaning mapping in order to do speech perception. but the _structure_ in the variation across talkers that makes it informative about _who_ the talker is makes it possible to adapt efficiently.
    * critically, in one way of thinking this inference relies on __expectations about what different kinds of talkers will sound like__.
    * present some evidence that people use these kinds of expectations to guide adaptation to an unfamiliar talker.



* speech perception, inference under uncertainty (people produce DISTRIBUTIONS of cues).
* distributions vary, and somehow listeners have to cope w/ this.
* distributional _learning_: when you meet a new talker, you can figure out their distributions by tracking, say, mean and variance of cues you encounter.
* question is: where do you _start_ this process of belief updating? what are your _prior beliefs_?
* you can rule out a lot of things based on your previous experience with other talkers. at one level, know that /b/ has a lower mean VOT than /p/. also, the means are postively correlated.

* picked this domain because:
    1. distributional learning works with it.
    2. there's not a lot of variability across talkers, so we predict that there will be pretty strong constraints from prior experience
    3. we have (or soon will have) pretty good estimates of what the variability is like across talkers _in the world_.

    * distributional learning paradigm: people hear b/p minimal pairs, click on picture matching what they heard.
    * we know that in these experiments, people adjust their category boundaries based on the distributions of cues, even without any kind of labeling information. [@Clayards2008, @Munson2011].
